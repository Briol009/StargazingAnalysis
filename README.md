# Stargazing Spot Search Analysis

Problem: Cities are known for their commercial epicenters and high population densities. By design, cities use artificial light to illuminate homes, businesses, and their streets. The ‘sky-glow’ effect, caused by light pollution, reduces visibility and causes challenges for city night sky lovers.

This project performs an analysis to search for an ideal night sky viewing locations, based on light pollution, cloud cover, and distance from a start point. The project code uses Google Earth Engine as a cyberinfrastructure to get images for each factor and combine them together. The final result is a map showing where ideal night sky locations are located, with a lighter color indicating bad (bright/not worthwile sky) and darker indicating good (dark, worthwhile views). 

### Run this application
Open the link below, wait a minute or two, and it will launch an interactive Jupyter Notebook containing my code. Follow the instructions in the notebook to set up a Google Earth Engine instance, then run all the cells (click Run at the top--> Run All Cells) and an interactive map application will appear.
